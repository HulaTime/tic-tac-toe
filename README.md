# tic-tac-toe

This is a very common tech test as it demonstrates a candidate's knowledge of basic data structures.

The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

- There are two players in the game (X and O) `done`
- Players take turns until the game is over `done`
- A player can claim a field if it is not already taken `done`
- A turn ends when a player claims a field `done`
- A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
- A game is over if a player wins
- A game is over when all fields are taken `done`

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.
